Back in the days of college, I remember a class where one of the projects was about rebuilding society after a collapse. The professor asked the class to form groups and devise a technological innovation to help the human race recover.

So off we went, forming groups, making introductions, and getting to work. I admit I used to be much more cynical, and were probably not as serious about the assignment as I should have been. Regardless, we did the research and prepared some ideas for the discussion in the next lecture.

The class was a kind of *social impacts of computers* type that seniors are required to take before graduation. I still find it funny how, after all the hard science classes---artificial intelligence, computer vision, etc.---the dean of our department thought it was necessary for us to think about the social impact of it all. To be clear, I agree, we definitely should; but the order of it just felt implicative. The image of Peter Parker and Uncle Ben comes to mind:

<q>...with great power there must also come---great responsibility!</q>

Was learning computer science like having super powers? well, again I can't say I disagree.

At the next lecture we formed a circle and started to share ideas. There were people who obviously took the assignment less seriously than I did, with ideas like robot zombie unicorn. There were general ideas like building more efficient power plants and the like. The majority of the ideas, however, involved building smartphone apps to make it easy to do this or that.

That had gotten me thinking about the Internet. Smartphones are great, but only if the Internet is still around. If the world collapsed and all we had were iPhones, what are they good for? (yes we'd [build an Internet](//project-byzantium.org/faqs) out of smartphones.) That got me thinking about how to restore the Internet, which lead me to doors.

Yes, **doors**! They're everywhere; not just everywhere, there's a pattern to their location. If you're indoors, you're next to a door. If you're not, you are probably going towards one. If somebody made a graph of Seattle where each node represent a door, I bet the maximum distance of any two adjacent nodes is less than 90 feet. That's less than the distance between home and first base.

I didn't share the idea during the discussion because it felt too good to be original. I started looking in to doors and what people have done with it---turns out not much. Most innovation with doors involve the way you lock/unlock it. Doors are so special, I think we can be much more creative:


1. ####Let's build a server in to the door
	
	In addition to a mesh network of doors, this opens an entire new landscape of possibilities for interesting applications, like keeping track of the number of occupants in a conference room, or automatically calling the elevator to the lobby when an hotel patron enters through the front door.

1. ####Let's put a cellphone tower in the door

	The implication is too much! Imagine never having poor cellphone signal. Imagine that, a world where the signal bar on your phone is obsolete.

1. ####Let's have doors generate power

	We all spend energy opening, closing, and, if you're a decent human being, holding open the door, why not transfer this energy in to electricity? I imagine a high traffic area would actually feed power back to the grid.


I didn't end up sharing the door idea with my group, and our project ended up being about an application to facilitate trades between the surviving civilizations. 

That wasn't my idea. But I wouldn't be surprise my door idea becomes a reality in my lifetime. The toaster stayed the same for a long time until [someone changed everything](//basheertome.com/hue).
