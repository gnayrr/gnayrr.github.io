The website is live at [epitome.io](//epitome.io "Go to epitome.io")

I created this project because I find story-writing to be a different animal than blog/article/editorial writing. I think part of that is the attitude and mindset of the writer. I found it difficult to write fiction and long form on the web without inadvertently morphing in to opinion pieces like blog entries.

I also wanted to create a space where text takes the front seat, and not UI/UX, icons, fonts, design flare, etc. The website itself is modeled after paper and typewriter. It uses a modified version of Markdown syntax with a few additions for inserting common typographic characters like **&eacute;**.

####Tech Overview

I used a number of open source software:

* [Ace Editor](//github.com/ajaxorg/ace "View on GitHub"): heavily modified with a custom edit mode

* [Backbone](//github.com/jashkenas/backbone "View on GitHub"): MVC, history, and event system

* [jQuery](//github.com/jquery/jquery "View on GitHub"): DOM manipulation and normalization

* [Mousetrap](//github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap "View on GitHub"): keyboard navigation and shortcuts

* [Lo-Dash](//github.com/lodash/lodash "View on GitHub"): working with arrays, strings, and functions

* [listr (my project)](//github.com/gnayrr/listr "View on GitHub"): DOM creation on the fly


The application is developed to use [isomorphic JavaScript](//nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps "Read on airbnb"), meaning the same code runs in the browser and on the server. The backend runs in node.js and uses mongoDB for storage. The client interacts with the backend through a REST API.

HTML5 history is used in browsers that support it, otherwise hashbangs are used.


####What's Next

The project itself was experimental in nature, and a lot of the code are scattered in different places. I will be pushing toward an initial release once I can get everything bundled up and uglified.

Also, I've recently began looking in to ways of implementing context-sensitive spellchecking on the client-side. I think that will be really cool.
