It happened again today. I was at an intersection without traffic lights, a car was coming through, and beyond the car, across from me, was another human being. I've never met her before but at that moment we both agreed to stop, and let the car pass.

I could have missed her, and just crossed the intersection, forcing the car to stop. Or I could have stopped while she went ahead. Then I would be the fool with whom she tries to avoid eye contact.

It's likely that we will never meet again, or at least if we do, we would not recognize each other. When we came close in the middle of the road, she gave me a glance and a friendly grin. Every time this happens I want to shout *we should be friends!* But I never do. And so we submerged ourselves, back in to the void, probably never to break the surface at the same time again.

None of this mattered at all, and is ultimately meaningless. But when she and I arrived at the same intersection, and made the same decision to stay put, somewhere in the universe a puzzle probably randomly fell in to place.
