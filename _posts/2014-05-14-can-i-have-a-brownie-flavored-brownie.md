Things that don't really have a flavor:

* Tofu

* Rice cake

* Marshmallow

Things that have tons of flavor:

* Coffee

* Cake

* Chocolate

* **BROWNIES**

When I walked by the chocolate store on the corner of my block today, I decided to get a brownie. I went in to the store, did the deed, then returned to my apartment. The world tells you to enjoy the small things in life, so I held off on biting in to the brownie right there in the elevator up to my floor.

Seconds later I'm standing in front of the stove, boiling water to make coffee. The anticipation was strong, and decadent. It's not like I can't always just have brownies for meal. I enjoy brownies but I don't eat it often. But things were different today, and I was looking forward to hunkering down on my sofa with my coffee, and brownie.

I never expected to bite in to a mint-flavored brownie. In fact, I expected not to. The thing is, the past few times I got brownies I received min-flavored variants. I had thought perhaps they just got me the wrong ones, but I hadn't voiced up. I kept going back, asking for the same thing, and receiving the same thing.

I was not going to justify it this time. Was I unreasonable to assume that brownie is its own thing? They don't make a turkey sandwich out of bull testicles do they?

I broke the brownie in half to watch the filling ooze out. I got normal brownies from this place before---they make really good normal ones. Usually it's rich gooey chocolaty fudge instead of this moss-colored amphibian blood.

I scraped the inside with my finger, broke the rest in to pieces, and haphazardly washed it down with coffee. At that moment, somewhere else, children are seeing their mothers’ pudgy, teary eyes for the last time as they shut their own eyes for the last time. A group of young woman are running for their lives in darkness and sand, trying to get away from dogmatic men with guns. So I'm okay.

Next time I won't judge things by the cover.

"Can I have the brownie-flavored brownie, please? Thank you."
