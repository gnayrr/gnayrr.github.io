description: "A Lo-Dash mixin for creating DOM elements"

I didn't want to learn a bunch of new methods and syntax to have DOM templates, so I took what everyone already knew about DOM elements, and devised a convention to allow intuitive DOM creation.

The project is [hosted on GitHub](//github.com/gnayrr/listr "listr: a Lo-Dash Mixin") with documentation and test cases. 

Live examples [here](//gnayrr.github.io/listr "listr Demo Page").
